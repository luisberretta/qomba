The full and complete Puma World Cup 2014 font is only available to those 
who will make a US$25 donation via PayPal. The donation should be made to 
font@airmail.cc

Do not forget to indicate the font you are interested in getting. There is 
an option in the payment form where you can send a short message. Place the 
name of the font there. In this case, this font is WC2014 Puma.

received. The font will only be sent to the email address of the person who 
made the donation as indicated in the PayPal notice unless there is a prior 
arrangement.

account. Please make sure that you are sending the donation to 
font@airmail.cc Remember that my account is FONT@AIRMAIL.CC

2. Login to your PayPal account and check the PayPal account where you sent 
the payment to. My PayPal account is font@airmail.cc  If there is a 
misspelling, get in touch with PayPal, inform them of the error and find out 
how to get your money back.
